#+TITLE: Exception Handling

This example application is for figuring out how ADF handles different exceptions on a range of events.
Investigate what needs to be done at minimum to ensure *all* exceptions are logged and a user friendly message is shown.
And how and where we can intervene to display other, more functional messages to the user.

The test results are from ADF 12.2.1.0.0 

* Exception types

  As stated in this [[https://blogs.oracle.com/jdevotnharvest/entry/displaying_exceptions_thrown_or_catched][OTN blog]] it is best to throw JboExceptions as these are handled best by the layers above.
  
** TODO JboException based exceptions

   Generated by JobsVO and Jobs Entity:
   - Create, remove and doDML methods in the JobsImpl.java
   - failOnJobRow method in JobsVORowImpl
   - failOnJobVO method in JobsVoImpl
   - throwCustomJboException method in ExceptionAMImpl

   Results:

** TODO Non JboException runtime exceptions

  Generated by RegionsVO and Regions entity:
  - Create, remove and doDML methods in the RegionsImpl.java
  - failOnRegionsRow method in RegionsVORowImpl
  - failOnRegionsVO method in RegionsVoImpl
  - throwCustomRuntimeException method in ExceptionAMImpl

  Results:

** TODO Checked exceptions

   Checked exceptions need to be handled and logged. What recommendations can we make to handle these

** TODO Custom ORA exceptions

   This trigger will throw a custom exception
   #+BEGIN_SRC sql
     create or replace trigger bi_job_history
     before insert on job_history
     declare
        custom_exception EXCEPTION;
        PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT(custom_exception, -20001);
     begin
       raise  custom_exception;
     end bi_job_history;
   #+END_SRC

   The JobHistoryVO will generate this error when inserting a new record that passes the validations


* Exceptions sources in bc
  
  The origin of exceptions thrown in business components can be roughly categorized as follows.
  This doesn't affect behavior but there are different ways to intervene with the exceptions to get the best results.
  
** TODO Execute Query
** TODO DML operations
** TODO Java Client interface
** TODO Validations


* Exception behavior in faces

** TODO ActionListener
** TODO Action
** TODO Method call in TF


* Translations
* Impact of exception handlers

** TODO Taskflow exception handler
** TODO DataControl error handler
** TODO View error handler
** TODO Servlet Container

* Logging
