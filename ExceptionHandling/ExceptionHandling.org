#+TITLE: Exception Handling

This example application is for figuring out how ADF handles different exceptions on a range of events.
Investigate what needs to be done at minimum to ensure *all* exceptions are logged and a user friendly message is shown.
And how and where we can intervene to display other, more functional messages to the user.

The test results are from ADF 12.2.1.0.0 

* Exception types

  As stated in this [[https://blogs.oracle.com/jdevotnharvest/entry/displaying_exceptions_thrown_or_catched][OTN blog]] it is best to throw JboExceptions as these are handled best by the layers above.
  
** TODO JboException based exceptions
** TODO Non JboException runtime exceptions
** TODO Checked exceptions
* Exceptions sources in bc
  
  The origin of exceptions thrown in business components can be roughly categorized as follows.
  This doesn't affect behavior but there are different ways to intervene with the exceptions to get the best results.
  
** TODO PL/SQL calls
** TODO Queries
** TODO DML operations
** TODO Java and APIs
** TODO Services
* Calls resulting in exceptions in faces

  Depending on how you do your calls to the BC components it will change how and wether they are displayed by default

** TODO Action on page
** TODO ActionListener on page
** TODO Method call in TaskFlow
** TODO Operation binding in beans
